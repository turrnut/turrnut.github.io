      <h1>THE CONSTITUTION OF THE TURRNUT REPUBLIC</h1>
      <p class="date">Last updated on November 14, 2023</p>
      <h3 id="part1">Chapter One: Preamble</h3>
      <p>In acknowledgment of the remarkable influence and revolutionary essence of the Turrnut Republic, we, the
        collective members, assemble to establish a foundational principle from which our shared ideals shall flourish,
        and our community shall be enriched. We hold the following truths to be self-evident, that the Turrnut Republic
        is founded upon these principles that shall guide our actions and our future.</p>
      <h3 id="part2">Chapter Two: Chapter Two: Rights of the People</h3>
      <p>The citizens of the Republic have the following basic rights that shall not be infringed:<br /><br />
        The citizens of the Republic shall possess the inherent and inviolable right to petition the government for the
        redress of grievances, seeking justice, and expressing concerns. This sacred right shall remain
        unassailable;<br />
        The citizens of the Republic are granted the right to remain silent, should they choose to do so, in the face of
        any inquiry or accusation. No individual shall be compelled to speak against their will, protecting their
        autonomy and preserving the presumption of innocence;<br />
        The citizens of the Republic shall have the unassailable right to express their thoughts, ideas, and opinions
        without fear of censorship or reprisal. This freedom extends to all forms of communication, including but not
        limited to speech, writing, and assembly;<br />
        The citizens of the Republic possess the solemn right to critique and hold accountable those in positions of
        authority, including staff members of the Republic. Constructive criticism and the expression of discontent
        shall be protected as a vital aspect of our commitment to accountability, transparency, and the pursuit of the
        common good; <br />
        The citizens of the Republic shall be treated with absolute equality, irrespective of their race, ethnicity,
        gender, sexuality, or religion. Discrimination in any form is expressly prohibited, and the government shall
        take affirmative measures to ensure that all individuals enjoy equal opportunities and protection under the law.
        <br /><br />
        These rights are deemed fundamental to the people of the Republic, for without them the Republic would be
        tyrannical and oppressive. <br />
      </p>
      <h3 id="part3">Chapter Three: Responsibilities of the People</h3>
      <p>
        While the citizens of the Republic have certain rights, they have responsibilities. Therefore, in conjunction
        with the rights declared, every member of the Republic bears certain responsibilities, which are indispensable
        to the preservation of our Republic. These responsibilities encompass:<br /><br />

        The responsibility to obey the Rules of the Republic, which are established to maintain order and justice within
        our society;<br />
        The responsibility to respect other members of the Republic, creating and encouraging an atmosphere of
        tolerance, cooperation, and unity;<br />
        The responsibility to speak up against unjust laws, for it is the duty of every citizen to strive for the just
        and equitable rule of law;<br />
        The responsibility to report any abuse of power, as transparency and accountability are essential to safeguard
        the principles upon which our Republic stands.<br /><br />

        The responsibilities outlined are considered fundamental to the Republic's well-being and existence. Without the
        adherence to these responsibilities, the Republic may descend into chaos and anarchy, thus undermining the
        rights and aspirations of its citizens.<br />
      </p>
      <h3 id="part4">Chapter Four: How the government is elect and organized</h3>
      <p>

        The Turrnut Republic, a democracy, is founded upon the consent of its people. Its leaders, known as
        Administrators, shall be selected by the citizens.<br /><br />

        The Administrator, the paramount figure amongst the legislative, executive, and judicial realms. They are
        elected on the day of June 6th and January 1st each year, known as Reelection Days. They shall also form the
        Jury and possess the authority to adjudicate in matters of justice. Three Administrators comprise this esteemed
        office, one of whom is the Republic's Owner, who, by the fundamental principles of the Constitution and
        Election, is not subject to electoral processes.In all legal matters, the Administrators shall serve as the
        Jury. They bear the responsibility of determining the guilt or innocence of the accused, upholding the
        principles of the Constitution.<br />
        The Moderators, possess the power of legislation, are appointed by the Administrators. While they hold the
        privilege to present their voices in court proceedings, they are bereft of the voting power in such matters.
        Their tenure may be subject to renewal under the reelection of new Administrators, with the maximum count of
        Moderators set at three.<br />
        One Judge, appointed by the Administrators, maintains the authority to propose the nullification of
        unconstitutional laws, bills, and statutes, subject to approval by over half of the Jury, composed of the
        Administrators. In court proceedings, the consensus of the majority serves as the ordinary path to
        decision-making, but the Judge possesses the exclusive ability to veto any verdict of the Jury, in cases of
        unconstitutionality, which may only be overruled by unanimous consent of the Jury, while also holds sway over
        the sentencing of those found guilty by the Administrator's Jury.<br />
        One Treasure is designated by the Administrators who is entrusted with the issuance of the Turrnut Currency, commonly referred to as Turrcoins.
        Furthermore, the Treasurer shoulders the solemn duty of safeguarding against the blight of
        inflation.<br /><br />

        The power of the Turrnut Republic shall be split into three branches:<br />
        The Legislative Branch, comprising Mods and Administrators. <br />
        The Executive Branch, comprising The Treasurer and Administrators.<br />
        The Judicial Branch, comprising The Judge and the Jury(the Administrators)<br />

      </p>
      <h3 id="part5">Chapter Five: How amendments can be made</h3>
      <p>The Constitution of the Turrnut Republic is the founding principle of our nation. Yet in recognition of the
        evolving needs of our government and its citizens, Amendments can be made to make the Constitution adaptive. An
        Amendment can only be made when two-thirds consent is achieved in the Legislative Branch, otherwise, the
        amendment shall not be passed.
